# How to Use:
# This file is generated by Visual Studio when you create a solution that contains one or more projects.
# You donâ€™t need to modify this file directly unless you want to change solution-wide settings or add more projects.
# When you open the solution file in Visual Studio, it will load the projects specified within it, allowing you to build, deploy, and test them as part of the solution.
